# Text-Summarizer-using-LSTM
Developed a Long Short Term Memory based neural networks to summarize the bulky documented Paragraphs to shorter single sentence texts
using Natural Language Processing in Python.

Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, re, Spacy,matplotlib,sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras,gensim,bs4,Nltk.


## Architecture

![alt text](https://github.com/SaiKumarNerella/Generating-Text-from-Images-using-OCR/blob/master/Input.png?raw=true)
 

Seq2Seq model with 

Encoder-Decoder
Bidirectional RNN
Adam Optimizer
exponential or cyclic learning rate



## Sample Paragraph
Review: windies all rounder dwayne bravo compared team india and rcb captain virat kohli to footballer cristiano ronaldo admire the talent he has 
the passion and talent that he has for the sport and the way he plays bravo added notably ronaldo is champions league all time top goalscorer 
with 120 goals and is the leading scorer this season with 15 goals

## Sample Summarizied Output
virat kohli is cristiano ronaldo of cricket dwayne bravo said
